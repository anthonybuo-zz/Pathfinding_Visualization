# Pathfinding Visualization

A pathfinding algorithm visualization on a square grid using breadth-first search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, 
and A* algorithm. 

The green square is the starting point and the red square is the goal. Click on a cell to add a wall and click on a wall to remove it.
Options like which algorithm is used, which directions can be traveled, and simulation speed can be configured before running the simulation.

To run the program, run the main executable in the dist directory.
